## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (3.0 or higher)
- Dart SDK (3.0 or higher)
- Android Studio / Xcode for platform-specific development
- Google Maps API key
- Firebase project configuration

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/omarabdullah1/wardaya.git
   cd wardaya
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Environment Setup**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your API keys and configuration

4. **Platform Setup**

   ```bash
   # For Android
   flutter build apk

   # For iOS
   flutter build ios
   ```

5. **Run the application**

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## üîß Configuration

### API Key Security

To protect sensitive API keys, we use environment variables and key obfuscation. Follow these steps to set up the Google Maps API key:

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root (this file is gitignored)
2. Add your Google Maps API key to the `.env` file:

   ```env
   MAPS_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
   ```

3. The app uses the `flutter_dotenv` package to securely access this key at runtime

### For Android

The app includes a placeholder API key in the checked-in `strings.xml` file. This key is replaced during the build process with the actual key from your environment.

### For iOS

For iOS, we use a method channel approach to securely pass the API key from Flutter to native code:

1. The `AppDelegate.swift` contains a placeholder API key
2. At runtime, the real API key is passed from Flutter to iOS native code using a method channel
3. This ensures the real API key is never stored in the source code

### CI/CD Pipeline

In your CI/CD pipeline, add a step to replace the placeholder API key with your actual key before building:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions step - Only needed for Android
- name: Replace API keys
  run: |
    sed -i 's/YOUR_MAPS_API_KEY_HERE/${{ secrets.GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY }}/g' android/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml
```

For iOS, no modifications to native files are needed as our method channel implementation handles this securely.

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/amazing-feature`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add amazing feature'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/amazing-feature`)
5. Open a Pull Request

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style and architecture patterns
- Write comprehensive tests for new features
- Update documentation as needed
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR

**Important**: Never commit API keys directly to the repository. Always use the environment variable approach described above.
